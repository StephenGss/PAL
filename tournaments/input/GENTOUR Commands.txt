You can change what axes are available during the tournament and their override values by modifying this json file.
"tools" is a JSON array of all tools to be spawned throughout a tournament
"toolsPerGame" is an integer value representing how many tools to give the agent in any single game
"overrideConfig" is a JSON array of tool efficiency overrides.
	"toolName" is the name of the tool. ex. "minecraft:wooden_axe"
	"efficiency" is a Float value representing how effecient the tool is. Minimum value 0.001. When breaking a block with the correct tool, the break_block cost gets divided by this number, so a higher efficiency will result in a better score.
